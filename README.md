BSPSource
=========

BSPSource is a map decompiler for [Source engine](http://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source) maps, written in Java.
It decompiles .bsp map files back to .vmf files that can be loaded in Hammer, Valve's official level editor.

BSPSource is based on a reengineered version of [VMEX 0.98g](http://www.bagthorpe.org/bob/cofrdrbob/vmex.html) by Rof, which is no longer developed and lacks
support for newer Source engine games.
